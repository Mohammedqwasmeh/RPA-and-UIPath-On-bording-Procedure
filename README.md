### General Overview About Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
**What is RPA (Robotic Process Automation):** Automation of a computer-centric
process using software robots.

RPA **Aims** to free humans of repetitive tasks by replacing them with a virtual
workforce and enabling them to focus on judgment calls, handle exceptions and
provide oversight.

### General Overview About UIPath Platform    

UiPath is a Robotic Process Automation tool which is used for repetitive business tasks automation. It is used to automate repetitive/redundant tasks and eliminates the human intervention.

The platform is simple to use and has a drag and drop functionality of [activities](https://activities.uipath.com/).

UiPath platform consists of three main components:

* UiPath Studio
* UiPath Robot
* UiPath Orchestrator

## Technical Onbording Track `IMPORTANT`

Our goal in the technical Onbording track is to craft a mechanism through which you as a new member in our RPA engineering unit acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to become an effective team member. We recommend starting with the `general programming skills` in order to build the foundation required for learning RPA skills. 

### `Step 1` - General Computer Programming Skills

#### Programming Concepts By [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) 
> If you work in a software development company as a non-programmer, you may wonder what the programmers do. And you hear new buzzwords everyday. This post was written with you in mind. Whether you are a sales person, a medical doctor, attorney, a business lead, or an accountant, if youâ€™ve ever had it in mind to learn how to code, this is a good place to start.

Recommended path: [Learn to code for free. - freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

#### A Complete Beginner's Guide to Programming
> This post is going to start out by discussing what computers are at a conceptual level, and then discuss the programming fundamentals. We'll use Python in this post, but a lot of the building blocks work across programming languages, so this will still help even if you are interested in learning a different language at first.

Your target here is to read the publication above and practise the same programming fundamentals using VB.NET programming language as `UIPath Studio` using VB.NET for activites macro coding.
