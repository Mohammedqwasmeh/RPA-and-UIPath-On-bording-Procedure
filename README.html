<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW95yb6J1eU">Robotic Process Automation (RPA): How does it work?
</a></p>
<p>RPA <strong>Aims</strong> to free humans of repetitive tasks by replacing them with a virtual
workforce and enabling them to focus on judgment calls, handle exceptions and
provide oversight.</p>
<h3 id="general-overview-about-uipath-platform">General Overview About UIPath Platform</h3>
<p>UiPath is a Robotic Process Automation tool which is used for repetitive business tasks automation. It is used to automate repetitive/redundant tasks and eliminates the human intervention.</p>
<p>The platform is simple to use and has a drag and drop functionality of <a href="https://activities.uipath.com/">activities</a>.</p>
<p>UiPath platform consists of three main components:</p>
<ul>
<li>UiPath Studio</li>
<li>UiPath Robot</li>
<li>UiPath Orchestrator</li>
</ul>

<p>This post is going to start out by discussing what computers are at a conceptual level, and then discuss the programming fundamentals. We'll use Python in this post, but a lot of the building blocks work across programming languages, so this will still help even if you are interested in learning a different language at first.</p>
